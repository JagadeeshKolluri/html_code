<h1 id="Birthplace">Birthplace"</h1>
<p> Baldwin IV of Jerusalem (Latin: Balduinus, French: Baudouin) (1161–1185), known as the Leper King, was the king of
    Jerusalem, from 1174 until his death in 1185. He was admired by his contemporaries and later historians for his
    willpower and dedication to the Latin Kingdom in the face of debilitating leprosy. Choosing competent advisers,
    Baldwin ruled a thriving crusader state and succeeded in protecting it from the Muslim ruler Saladin.

    Baldwin developed the first symptoms of leprosy as a child but was only diagnosed after he succeeded his father,
    King Amalric (r. 1163–1174). Thereafter his hands and face became increasingly disfigured. Count Raymond III of
    Tripoli ruled the kingdom in Baldwin's name until the king reached the age of majority in 1176. As soon as he
    assumed government, Baldwin planned an invasion of Egypt, which fell through because of his vassals'
    uncooperativeness. Saladin in turn attacked Baldwin's kingdom in 1177, but the King and the nobleman Raynald of
    Châtillon repelled him at Montgisard, earning Baldwin fame. The young king mastered horse riding despite gradually
    losing sensation in his extremities and was able to fight in battles until his last years.

    Leprosy prevented Baldwin from marrying. He hoped to abdicate when his sister, Sibylla, married William of
    Montferrat in 1176, but William died the next year. In 1180, in order to forestall a coup by Count Raymond III of
    Tripoli and Prince Bohemond III of Antioch, Baldwin had Sibylla marry Guy of Lusignan. Guy was opposed by a large
    fraction of the nobility, and soon permanently impaired his relationship with Baldwin. The internal discord that
    followed forced Baldwin to remain king, as only he was capable of uniting the quarreling nobility. Baldwin again
    repelled Saladin in 1182 but leprosy rendered him blind and unable to walk or use his hands in 1183. He disinherited
    Guy and had Sibylla's son, Baldwin V, crowned co-king before having himself taken in a litter to lift Saladin's
    siege of Kerak. Baldwin failed to have Sibylla's marriage to Guy annulled and Guy's fief of Ascalon confiscated. In
    early 1185 he arranged for Raymond to rule as regent for Sibylla's son and died before 16 May.</p>
<h1 id="History">History</h1>
    <p> Baldwin IV was born in mid-1161. His parents were Amalric, then the count of Jaffa and Ascalon, and Agnes of
        Courtenay. Baldwin's godfather was his paternal uncle, King Baldwin III, who joked that his christening present
        was the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The king was young and recently married, making a nephew's accession seem
        unlikely; yet Baldwin III died childless in 1163.[1] Amalric was his heir, but the nobles of the kingdom were
        strongly opposed to Amalric's wife, Agnes; they were likely threatened by the prospect of her increased
        influence.[2] The High Court forced Amalric to agree to an annulment of his marriage on the grounds of
        consanguinity in order to be accepted as king.[1] Amalric succeeded in having his and Agnes's children, Sibylla
        and Baldwin, declared legitimate despite the annulment. Baldwin grew up without a mother, as she soon remarried
        (firstly to Hugh of Ibelin[2] and then to Reynald of Sidon[3]) and only saw Baldwin on public occasions.[2] He
        also seldom saw his sister, Sibylla, who was raised in the Convent of Saint Lazarus by their grandaunt
        Ioveta.[2] At the age of six Baldwin gained a stepmother, Maria Komnene, with whom he was not close. The Queen
        was an ambitious woman who likely saw Baldwin as an obstacle to her own children.[4]</p>
    <h1 id="Childhood">Childhood</h1>
    <p>The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other crusader principalities, though surrounded by Arab Muslim states, were ruled
        by Franks, French-speaking Catholics who had arrived in the Levant from Western Europe and remained Western in
        culture.[5] Amalric ensured that Baldwin, as the heir apparent to the kingdom, received a good education. The
        nine-year-old prince was sent to live with William of Tyre, a sophisticated and well-traveled cleric who was
        famed for his learning. William noticed that, unlike other children in the playground, Baldwin did not cry when
        pinched by his peers. After a while it became apparent to the tutor that Baldwin could not feel pain in his
        right arm.[4] The King hired Arabs to treat Baldwin and to teach him horse riding, an essential skill for a
        Frankish nobleman. Having sensation in only one hand, Baldwin needed to learn to control the horse in battle
        using solely his knees, and mastered riding despite the handicap. Leprosy was suspected, but there were no
        visible symptoms yet and physicians hesitated to diagnose because of the stigma the boy would face.[6] Had the
        diagnosis been made when he was a child, Baldwin might have been required by law to enter the Order of St
        Lazarus, a military order composed of affected knights and serjeants.[7]

        As an adolescent, Baldwin was precocious, determined, and optimistic in the face of his illness. He took after
        his father in good looks, body shape, and manner of walking and expressing himself. Baldwin was a quick learner,
        but he stuttered. He enjoyed listening to stories and history lessons. His tutor, William, remarked on Baldwin's
        excellent memory, stating that he forgot neither kindness nor slights done to him by others.[8]

        Amalric attempted to have Sibylla marry the French Count Stephen I of Sancerre, who would rule the kingdom as
        regent on Baldwin's behalf if Amalric died early. When physicians informed him that Baldwin could develop
        leprosy, Amalric may have begun viewing Sibylla and Stephen as eventual monarchs instead of Baldwin, but the
        match fell through.[9] In June 1174 the King came down with dysentery. He died on 11 July leaving an underage
        heir, as he had feared might happen.[10]

        Accession

        Patriarch Amalric crowns King Baldwin IV, as depicted in late 13th-century edition of the Histoire d'Outre Mer
        Upon Amalric's death, the High Court convened to discuss the succession.[10] Though he had not yet been
        diagnosed the High Court must have been aware of the royal physicians' suspicions that Baldwin had contracted
        leprosy.[11] Yet there was no viable alternative. Baldwin was the King's only son; from his second marriage
        Amalric had two daughters, of which only Isabella survived infancy.[9][12] Female succession was expressly
        allowed, but Sibylla was an unmarried adolescent and Isabella only two years old.[13] The male candidates,
        Amalric's cousins Prince Bohemond III of Antioch, Baldwin of Antioch, and Count Raymond III of Tripoli, were
        politically unsuitable: Bohemond was bound to distant Antioch, Baldwin in the service of Byzantine Emperor
        Manuel I Komnenos, and Raymond virtually a stranger to the barons after nine years spent in Muslim
        captivity.[14]

        After three days of deliberation[10] Baldwin IV was chosen, with the expectation that a husband would be found
        for Sibylla to succeed him if he proved to be affected.[15] The young king's coronation by the Latin patriarch
        of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle,</p>

            <p>Until he reached the age of majority, which was 15 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Baldwin needed a regent
                to rule in his name.[17] The government was initially assumed by the seneschal, Miles of Plancy.[18][12]
                Shortly thereafter Count Raymond III of Tripoli arrived in Jerusalem and succeeded in claiming regency
                as the King's closest kinsman.[19] Miles was murdered while trying to extend his hold on the
                government.[20][21] No new seneschal was appointed for two years, and so the young and sickly king
                presided over burdensome High Court meetings when the regent was away on military duties or in
                Tripoli.[22]

                Baldwin's mother, Agnes, returned to court when Raymond became regent. She is frequently accused by
                historians of exploiting her son's condition for self-gain, but the contemporary sources, including
                Baldwin's tutor, William of Tyre, are biased against her.[22] Having grown up without her since the age
                of two, Baldwin had no memories of his mother, but she became devotedly kind to him and he developed a
                strong attachment to her.[23]</p>
